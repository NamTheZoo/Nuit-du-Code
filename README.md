# Nuit-du-Code
Project of the Nuit du Code 2023-2024
This contains the project that 3 classmates and myself created in June of 2023, as well as a future project that we will be doing in May 2024.
Out of 5 other teams, we were the only ones to make a working game, the other teams did a good job at making the design of their game, but didn't have the time to finish coding their actual game.
Please keep in mind  that it was the first time any of us coded a game and we had to do it in 6 hours while intoxicated by soda and pizza.
